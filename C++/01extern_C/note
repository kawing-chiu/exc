Use the following command line to create a shared library:

g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -shared -fPIC $1 -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN' \
    -Wl,--no-undefined -l... -L. ... -o ...


add -Wl,-soname,lib<name>.so.<ver> in production

also add -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN', to make the library usable outside of
standard paths, see man ld.so

-Wl,--no-undefined should be added, too. Otherwise if we forget to link
some libraries using '-l', no error or warning will be issued.


Added Nov 20 2015: 

use -fvisibility=hidden to hide unused symbols, and export the necessary ones
using __attribute__ ((visibility ("default"))) in code.

However, be careful with exceptions and other entities with 'vague linkage'.
They must not be hidden. Refer to https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility.
