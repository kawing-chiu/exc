The observer pattern is used in the situation where many observers subscribe to 
changes in an subject. Whenever the subject is changed, all of the observers 
are notified. Then the observers can query the subject for information and then 
act accordingly.

This is implemented by keeping a vector of observers (pointers of course) in 
the subject while keeping a pointer to the subject in every oberver (this 
pointer should go into the base class of all the observers, obviously).
