The abstract factory, just as its name implies, creates an abstract interface 
to create different types of objects. The factory classes are meant to be used 
like this:

    #ifdef WINDOWS
        Factory *factory = new WindowsFactory;
    #else
        Factory *factory = new LinuxFactory;
    #endif

That is, the exact type of object to use is chosen at initialization of the 
program.
