C++ cannot have virtual constructors. The virtual constructor idiom similates 
it.

The meaning of covariant return type is: if a derived class method returns a 
more specific type than its overridden base class method, the derived class 
return type is said to be covariant. For example:

class Base {
public:
    virtual Base* clone() const
    {
        return new Base(this);
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    virtual Derived* clone() const
    {
        return new Derived(this);
    }
};

This language feature allows the corresponding virtual function in the derived 
class correctly overrides the one in the base class.
