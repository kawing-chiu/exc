Inline functions in C99 is a quite confusing topic.

In short, it is intended to be used like this:

In some header:

//myheader.h
inline float square(float x) { return x*x; }

This header can be included in many modules and no external callable
version of the function is produced.


To produce an external callable version:

In one and only one .c file:

//mysource.c
extern inline float square(float x);


It is weird that the definition goes into the header while the
declaration goes into the source, but this is how it works.

Also note that the optimization compile option (-O) has an effect on whether 
inline actually applies.


In C++, inline definitions always goes into header like in C99, but there is no such
thing as 'extern inline'. So nothing needs to be put into .cpp files.
