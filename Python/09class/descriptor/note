Descriptors are used for defining reusable "clever" attributes. The most simple 
way is to use the @property, @x.setter and @x.deleter decorators. This method 
works for simple cases but it's not resuable.

Full-fledged descriptors are defined by a class with special methods __get__, 
__set__ and __delete__. Then instances of this class are used as attributes in 
other classes. Decriptor classes often use a WeakKeyDictionary to do 
bookkeeping. This is because all instances of the class using the descriptor 
use the same instance of the descriptor class.
