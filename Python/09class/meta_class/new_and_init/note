After the class definition is read, Python executes Meta(name, bases, dct),
if metaclass is not specified, then it defaults to type. Normally, the
metaclass Meta should be a subclass of type.

The call to Meta() executes the following methods just like normal classes:

    NewClass = Meta.__new__(Meta, name, bases, dct)
    Meta.__init__(NewClass, name, bases, dct)

The difference is that the target is the new class and these methods are executed when the class is defined.
